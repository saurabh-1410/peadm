## 2.5.0
### Summary

### Changes

- Require WhatsARanjit-node\_manager >= 0.7.5
- Require puppetlabs-stdlib >= 6.5.0

### Improvements

- Support PE 2021.0
- Handle exit code 11 from replica upgrade task gracefully. Code 11 means "PuppetDB sync in progress but not yet complete"
- Further remediate the bug fixed in 2.4.2, by ensuring that all peadm-managed node groups preserve existing data or class parameters not explicitly being managed
- Switch dependency enumeration from in-project Puppetfile to bolt-project.yaml modules setting

## 2.4.5
### Summary

Bugfix release

### Bugfixes

* Fix an issue in the convert plan incorrectly disallowing conversion of deployments newer than 2019.7.0.
* Fix a problem with the Peadm::SingleTargetSpec type alias.
* Fix peadm::puppet\_runonce to correctly return a failure if the Puppet agent run had resource failures.

## 2.4.4
### Summary

Support PE 2019.8.4 and newer 2019.8.z releases

### Improvements

- Validation should Permit installing or upgrading to any PE 2019.8.z release

## 2.4.3
### Summary

Support PE 2019.8.3

### Improvements

- Support installing or upgrading to PE 2019.8.3

## 2.4.2
### Summary

Bugfix release

### Bugfixes

- Previously, on upgrade, peadm could overwrite user configuration data on the PE Master group because it overwrote the entire configuration data value. This release modifies the peadm::setup::node\_manager desired state configuration to merge required configuration into any existing configuration when configuring data on the PE Master node group.

## 2.4.1
### Summary

Bugfix release

### Bugfixes

- Previously, on upgrade, peadm did not ensure that PostgreSQL servers' pe.conf file contained the critical keys that inform the installer that the system is a stand-alone database. The peadm::upgrade plan now ensures the critical keys are correct as part of the upgrade preparation.
- When upgrading a DR replica to PE 2019.8.0 or 2019.8.1, there is an installer bug that causes the upgrade to fail due to how `puppetdb delete-reports` performs in this configuration. This release works around the problem by bypassing `puppetdb delete-reports`. This workaround will be removed in future releases of peadm after the installer / `puppetdb delete-reports` bug is fixed.

## 2.4.0
### Summary

Readme updates and further convert plan efficiency improvements

### Features

- In the peadm::convert plan, certificates which already contain requested extensions will not be re-issued. This will accelerate the convert process, or allow re-runs of the convert process to move more quickly.

### Improvements

- The README now provides more detailed information on how customers using the peadm module should go about getting support for it.

## 2.3.0
### Summary

Add ability to resume peadm::upgrade or peadm::convert at an intermediate step, rather than requiring re-runs to perform all plan actions from the beginning.

### Features

- Added `begin_at_step` parameter and documentation to peadm::upgrade and peadm::convert

### Bugfixes

- In peadm::convert plan, stop the Puppet agent before writing the csr\_attributes.yaml file, to prevent possible agent interference
- In the peadm::convert plan during finalization, run the Puppet agent on the primary server first, then the rest, to avoid the possibility of a puppetserver restart impacting Puppet agent runs on other systems.

### Improvements

- In the peadm::convert plan, when no peadm\_availability\_group trusted fact is present to identify if compilers should be members of the A pool or B pool, check for pp\_cluster being used to designate this configuration before falling back to a simple even/odd split. This is to catch systems provisioned with the old pe\_xl module, which used pp\_cluster to designate A/B.

## 2.2.1
### Summary

Bugfix release

### Bugfixes

- Fixed problem with `internal_compiler_b_pool_address` parameter name in peadm::action::configure plan

## 2.2.0
### Summary

Reliability fixes for 2019.8.1, README updates, and simpification of the convert plan. New parameters added for `internal_compiler_a_pool_address` and `internal_compiler_b_pool_address` to configure lb addresses for each half of the compiler pool, so that this configuration does not need to be re-applied after upgrades.

### Features

- Added parameters to configure compiler pool addresses for the A and B availability groups. These are used in large and extra large architectures.
- Add basic informational messages to upgrade plan output, to communicate when different stages of the upgrade begin.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed GH-118, wherein a compiler would unnecessarily send duplicate work to an extra configured PuppetDB endpoint.
- Puppet infra upgrade operations now always wait until target nodes are connected before attempting an operation

### Improvements

- Provide a useful overview of the module in the README so that readers can quickly gain a sense of how the module is used, what it affects, and what it does not affect.
- Eliminate `configure_node_groups` parameter to peadm::convert. Perform the correct action(s) automatically.

## Release 2.1.1
### Summary

Development tool and README fixes.

### Bugfixes

- Remove reference to Puppet Support team from README. This module is intended to be used in collaboration with Professional Services and Solutions Architects at Puppet, not Support
- Fixes and improvements to Docker development tools
